# Jonch Quiz Game

This is my attempt of implementing a quiz game in ReactJS with an express backend inspired by the 5 projects to complete when starting to learn Web Development (https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178).

Clone this repository and run `npm install` on the root directory followed by `npm start` to get the front end working.
To get the backend running, you will need to navigate into the `quizBackend` folder and then do `npm install` followed by `node index.js`.

The quiz questions are populated from a CSV file found in the `quizBackend/public` directory. Feel free to modify this file and add more questions if you like :)
